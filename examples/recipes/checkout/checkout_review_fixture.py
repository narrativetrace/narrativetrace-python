"""One successful checkout, the flow
documentation/recipes/review-a-complex-flow-before-changing-it.md is read before changing anything.

A fixture because two readers need the same run under different settings: ``recipe_artifacts.py``
runs it in its own pytest process once at DETAIL and once at SUMMARY. It passes either way --
nothing here fails by design. The log lines are the same flow through the project's own ``logging``
setup (``conftest.py``).
